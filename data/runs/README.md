# Runs

## Preparation

The run files from the Touché 2022 task 2 were provided by [Touché organizers](https://webis.de/events/touche-22/shared-task-2.html#task-committee).
Place the files under `data/runs`.
The folder structure should be `data/runs/<TEAM>/output/run<NUMBER>` where `<TEAM>` is each team's name and `<NUMBER>` is the run number (up to 5 runs).

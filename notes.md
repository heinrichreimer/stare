# Notes

## Story

we want to see pro1/pro2/neutral first, so push docs with no stance to end of ranking
-> improves ndcg@5 for all touch√© runs
but now we might have pushed subjective documents to the top, so let's ensure rankings are fair now
discount scores by the group exposure in the ranking

Important: Protected groups are calculated per query because pro1 doesn't describe the same objects in different queries.
